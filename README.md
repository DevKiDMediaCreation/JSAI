# For Community: How to make a Pull Request
When someone makes a pull request, the user must create a new branch or use an available branch with their name at the top. For example, if you are sine, you must use a branch that starts with sine-... . If you later want to merge the branch into the main branch, only admins and people with bypass permissions can merge their data and code into the main branch. If you want your branch to be merged into the main branch and you don't have admin rights or permissions, you can send an email to sinusaeth+githubsupportJTSAM@gmail.com to merge your branch into the main branch. The email SUBJECT: GitHub JTSAM Support. The code is checked and the differences to the main code are added. The branch will be an example of MainBranch..Ver... for users who do not have administrator and permission rights. For example, for Sinus, it is Sinus-MainBranch..Ver.Src...
